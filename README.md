# Obsidian Iframes
This plugin allows you to use the iframe tag in your obsidian notes to refer to local files.
Works by replacing the src attribute of the iframe tag with a global path using the file:// URI scheme.

## TODO
- Add support for iframing markdown files by parsing it and rendering it in obsidian.
