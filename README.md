# Obsidian Iframes
This plugin allows you to use the iframe tag in your obsidian notes to refer to local files.
Works by replacing the src attribute of the iframe tag with a global path using the file:// URI scheme.

## MD files
This plugin also allows you to "iframe" an MD file, which will include its code in the document (can be another document or an online source)

To use, just use the src attribute in an iframe tag:
